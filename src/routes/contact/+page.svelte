<div class="limit mx-auto">
    <h1>Contact Me</h1>

    <h2>Discord</h2>

    If you already share a discord server with me, the best way to reach me is on discord.
    <br>
    <b class="numbers">I do not accept friend requests!</b>
    <br>
    My discord is <span class="numbers">ajgeiss0702#0702</span>
    <br>

    <h2>Email</h2>

    The second best way to contact me is via email.<br>
    My main email address is
    <span class="numbers">
        <a href="mailto:ajgeiss0702@ajg0702.us">ajgeiss0702@ajg0702.us</a>
    </span>
    <br>
    However, sometimes my mail server is kinda dumb, so I'd recommend CC'ing
    <span class="numbers">
        ajgeiss72@gmail.com
    </span>
