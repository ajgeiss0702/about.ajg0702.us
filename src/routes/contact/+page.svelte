<div class="limit mx-auto p-2">
    <h1 class="h1">Contact Me</h1>

    <h2 class="h2">Discord</h2>

    <p>
        If you already share a discord server with me, the best way to reach me is on discord.
        <br>
        <b>I do not accept friend requests!</b>
        <br>
        My discord is <span class="numbers">ajgeiss0702</span> (no hash/discriminator)
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="h2">Email</h2>

    <p>
        The second best way to contact me is via email.<br>
        My main email address is
        <a href="mailto:ajgeiss0702@ajg0702.us" class="font-bold">ajgeiss0702@ajg0702.us</a>
        <br>
        I used to recommend CC'ing my gmail due to unreliability, but I have changed email providers so that is no longer an issue.
